Ariel Data Challenge 2022 ML model for the 2nd Place by gators team
You need to download the data from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17hs92QJvrs32h9SZXvq_oY32TA_ZSge6?usp=sharing to make the model work. 
I will update the repo soon to make the model more readable, feel free to contact me if you encounter a problem.
